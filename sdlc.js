const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisAndRequirements = "During this step a User Story is created to articulate what the customer is trying to accomplish. The project manager or developer will ask clarifying questions to scope the technical requirements to meet the needs of the customer."
const design = "The project manager, or customer directly, will try to look at the programming needs and customer needs to ensure the requirements are being interpretted correctly. During this phase requirements for both desing and development are clarified. "
const testingAndIntegration = "The development, or delivery, team installs the code, or application, in an environment that the customer can provide testing for the desired outcome. The development team looks for opportunities for clarification and improvmement to best align to the cusotmers needs."
const implementation = "Final installation of the tested product to 'go-live'. This may be a product that is missing some formating or style that can be added later. During implementation, the application should align with agreed upon customer expectations for the work cycle, a.k.a., sprint."
const maintain = "As users find bugs or earros, these items are launched back to the first step for the development team to correct or improve upon these items."
